    Hello! My name is David and I enjoy developing software to solve problems.
    My interest in software engineering started back in 
    2017 when my employer was short engineering resources and I decided 
    to try editing/fixing python scripts that flashed android tablets with
    custom images — turns out reading/editing previous written code 
    taught me a lot about python, GitHub and application upkeep!
    <br></br>
    Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of managing 
    software engineering projects such as the development of a 
    quality control application to run diagnostics on android tablets/peripheral hardware
    and the development of a module for an asset managment application to allow returned 
    hardware components to be reused.
    <br></br>
    To better manage software development projects, I decided to further
    my education by taking General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive
    course to learn best practices to write and maintain DRY, 
    organized and well documented code.
    <br></br>
    My main focus these days is to find the next project that combines
    my passion for environemental sustainability with my interest in
    software development.

    Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
