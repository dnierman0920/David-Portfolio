I describe myself as an interested person. In other words,
I find myself easily interested in learning how things work 
or how they came to be or how to iterate on them for different uses.
My career started in Supply Chain Mgmt learning how products were
made and distributed from cradle to grave. While working in Supply Chain Mgmt,
I leveraged a lot of software tools which exposed me to the world of software development!
In short, I am excited and passionate to learn and to develop innovate software solutions.
